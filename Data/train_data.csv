Someone with no medical knowledge so cant even have a guess at what is causing them to feel unwell waits an hour and a half to get through to 111. Then instead of being able to use their instincts, the ticky box of queationsnis gone through. Advice hiven or the standard someone will ring back in iup to 2 hrs but if symptoms get worse. Patient therefore puts phone down and waits for the call but after an hour starts to feel much worse, say for example its (sepsis) but call ahdnker didnt pik up on it ticky box way, so patient does what they are told because they are feeling worse so they ring 111 back and wait in a call queue again for an hour and 20 mins but by the time the call handler at 111 takes the call the patient cant really string wodss together so call handler by this point makes it an urgent 999 ambulance despatch.However after the hour and a half wait to get through first time plus the hour wait for a medical pro to ring back and another hour and a bit wait to get back through to 111 the persons Selsis has turned to Septic shock, very hard to comenout of alive or without life changing effects.So there is my opinion of how in sone ways 111 is not fit fir purpose.Great in what it does, but the way 1q1 works it also costs lives.",,4,,,1,,1,,,,,,,,,1,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

When I called Parkway Medical they had no record of this, and that NHS111 should have booked for me, so couldn’t give me a GP check and to go to a walk-in centre. As I had previously been admitted on an antibiotic drip for two days from RVI ambulatory care with the same symptoms, and had been told to be seen the same day by the GP, I was surprised the NHS111 had not notified the surgery. I called NHS111 to check if they had contacted the GP and that if I went to a walkin centre that they would have the necessary info from my call, and was told they would contact me. A person called back who informed me that this was just an emergency service, of which I am very aware, and had not requested a call back, just wanting to know if the info would be sent, as so far it had not been. The GP practice subsequently mentioned that they do not always receive notifications of calls, even for the same day so this had meant I had waited until the GP practice opened before being told to travel some distance to the walkin centre. I understood the service was to be used if the GP practice was not open and I had been following NHS directions to ring if GP practice not open and I was puzzled as to why NHS111 had not informed the GP to enable a same day examination as suggested. I went to a walkin centre and was sent to hospital again, subsequently seeing a consultant. There seems to be a lack of communication between NHS111 and GP practice, and the GP practice has a tendency to overuse NHS111 telling me to ring 111 when I merely ring for a GP appointment.

I was referred to by someone from PTS, and was misled into thinking it was further therapy for my post-natal depression. On [Date Redacted] I had an initial assessment with a junior doctor, which I had waited 2 months for. She asked me questions about my life and I told her a lot, believing that it was therapy. I spoke for an hour, and during the session I was made to feel like I didn't have post natal depression. I was told by this doctor that all the events in my life was just making me feel sad. I was and I am still, having suicidal thoughts every single day and my mood has changed drastically since giving birth. I have never felt so low in my entire life, but for some reason this was downplayed by the junior doctor, and I felt belittled. At the end of the session she asked me if I was willing to take medication, and I said no. She then told me that she can't help me because all they do there is medicate people, and that they don't do therapy. I don't understand why she made me pour my heart out for an hour, and talk about my life, if at the end of the day she just wanted me to take her drugs. I was deeply upset and disappointed with this service. It was a massive waste of my time and energy and I went home in tears feeling 100 times worse than when I got there. Please can you educate your junior doctors on what post natal depression is, and how hormonal imbalance can really affect your mood, in which some women can have depression, some can even have psychosis and commit suicide. It is serious and not something that should be downplayed. I was told that I would be referred back to pts, but I still have not heard anything from anyone.

Suffered breakdown 14 months before having terrible suicidal thoughts for months, not controlled or treated well by GP. Saw the nurse at Heather close. Explained how I felt. Advised me to go on a walk, and when I said ""what do I do if I feel I can't keep myself safe"" said ""just keep busy"". I saw a specialist prescriber there at the same time. Asked him to review and change my medication, as clearly making me unwell. Expected a service. Was referred back to my GP. A week later I was no better and felt so unwell with dark thoughts, I rang the crisis team at Millbrook outpatients, who saw me the next day, stopped my medication. Started me on a suitable medicine. Within three months I'm back at work, working as a nurse. What was the point of having a prescriber at Heather close if he was not willing to help me, like the crisis team ended up having to do.  Local mentality team is a waste of time and money, and needs looking at why that happened. I have a young family and wonder how many others get turned away.

NHFT 57 - Q1,NHFT,NHFT 57,12/06/2021,Local partnerships- MH,Adult mental health,5,What could we do better?,"So let down. I understand the pandemic has disrupted services but this shouldn't alter the amount of group therapy given. Using the pandemic as an excuse to cut out months at the end of my group therapy because you thought I needed support then rather than later, is unacceptable. I wasn't given the option to make the decision for myself in my care. I had no choice I had to take the phone calls. If I had the choice I would've waited for group therapy to start rather than having to take one to one phone calls, as part of my group therapy time scale. If I was told that those phone calls would be taken off the end of my group therapy, and if I was given the choice I would've waited for group to start. Those phone calls really should've been classed as support calls rather than group MBT. I have waited years for this personalised therapy, I only get one chance in my lifetime to access it. Yet you have cut my time short by months. I now have to sit in group therapy listening to my therapist say to the new starters that they will have a ""full year of group therapy to explore their difficulties."" Hearing those words was like a dagger to my heart. You chose to end my therapy on fri 13th, the most unlucky day of the year. Also 3 days before my birthday. I also found out that I'm the first person to leave the group even though we all started together. Do you know how that all feels? Obviously no, thought has gone in to thinking about the individual, me. How all this would make me feel. I was also told I was going to get an Autism assessment. I've not heard anything so I guess this is no longer going ahead. I was told this assessment would help see if I have Autism or other mental health disorders, as it is looking like I have more than BPD. Now I feel all this research has stopped because of how soon you are making me leave, as there is not enough time now. I had high hopes for getting the treatment time needed but you didn't give it me. You can't alter treatment because of a pandemic especially when this treatment is a one off access. I understand that the pandemic put a hold on things that's fine, but to take away group therapy time is unacceptable.",,5,,,,,,,,,,1,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I was referred to by someone from PTS, and was misled into thinking it was further therapy for my post-natal depression. On [Date Redacted] I had an initial assessment with a junior doctor, which I had waited 2 months for. She asked me questions about my life and I told her a lot, believing that it was therapy. I spoke for an hour, and during the session I was made to feel like I didn't have post natal depression. I was told by this doctor that all the events in my life was just making me feel sad. I was and I am still, having suicidal thoughts every single day and my mood has changed drastically since giving birth. I have never felt so low in my entire life, but for some reason this was downplayed by the junior doctor, and I felt belittled. At the end of the session she asked me if I was willing to take medication, and I said no. She then told me that she can't help me because all they do there is medicate people, and that they don't do therapy. I don't understand why she made me pour my heart out for an hour, and talk about my life, if at the end of the day she just wanted me to take her drugs. I was deeply upset and disappointed with this service. It was a massive waste of my time and energy and I went home in tears feeling 100 times worse than when I got there. Please can you educate your junior doctors on what post natal depression is, and how hormonal imbalance can really affect your mood, in which some women can have depression, some can even have psychosis and commit suicide. It is serious and not something that should be downplayed. I was told that I would be referred back to pts, but I still have not heard anything from anyone. I feel let down, disappointed and even more depressed as a result.",,5,,,,,,,,,,1,,,1,,,,1,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Poor service which could make the difference between life/death/hospitalisation. What is point of having these meds available for patients like me, if the service doesn’t recognise the importance of the dispensing of them being time critical, and training call taker staff to have actual knowledge of the scheme!

They showed compassion and understanding, explained everything, what was just protocol and why. Explained why they needed to take him in to hospital, apologised that I couldn’t go with him but gave me an approx time to call the hospital for an update. They were amazing and I felt reassured that my husband was in good hands.The contracted out ambulance staff who attended on 23rd feb 2022 were abrupt and appeared reluctant to help. Some more patient care and communication with the patient, explaining why they wanted him to move when in severe pain and struggling to breathe and how they believed it would help him would have been better received rather than my husband struggling to utter the words “help me” and two staff just standing watching him. They seemed very uneasy when a family member showed up who was actually NEAS staff. They did not interfere with the ambulance staff but did try to get them to take my husbands medication to which they refused, which surprised my family member given the medication. They said it was just a panic attack, despite having a temperature and being deathly white in colour. Thankfully he got better care in the hospital.

My husband had severe bladder spasms he was Deafblind with Alstrom Syndrome, severe dilated cardiomyopathy and bowel cancer and a bladder and urethra infection.   Did he not deserve help and attention?  I did get cross as I indicated to call handlers if he had been a drunk or a druggie he would have had medical help long before this.  I had to insist to final paramedic call handler that his condition may have been terminal but at that moment in time there had been no indication either to myself or professional medical team involved in his care to make us believe he was dying that day.  Even if he had been he was in severe pain they could hear him and felt they treat him worse than an animal leaving it so long before they agreed to send an ambulance.  I believe I made the first call between 7-8 and the ambulance wasn’t despatched u til after midnight.  If i had been able to move him I would have put him in car and taken there by myself.  I actually received this text today whilst sitting with the registrar registering his death.  I will always believe this delay and the trauma he suffered weakened him so much he died earlier than he may have done otherwise.  I will also always be haunted by the fact everyone seemed  to work  from a script and there was no scope for clinical judgement or common sense or actually humanity",,5,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,1,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

On other occasions we would have a call scheduled in and I would be waiting but the call would never come. I would then hear nothing until the following week when our next appointment was due and he would behave as if nothing had happened. During the sessions the therapist often talked over me, he would ask me a question and then go off on a tangent and not allow me to get a word in. One of the main issues I had was that he didn't take my opinions into account, particularly concerning my ongoing treatment. I felt I was not ready to be discharged from the service but there was a continual pressure for me to do so. The therapist kept bringing this up in our sessions and eventually texted me to tell me that I was being discharged from the service despite my wishes. In the message he explained the reason for this being that he was under pressure from management due to an extensive waiting list, I feel this is an unacceptable reason to discharge someone still in need of support. Over all I feel the lack of care and poor communication has really affected my experience and that the delivery of this type of service should be monitored more closely. I still feel that I am struggling with issues I really need support with.

NHFT 937 - Q1,NHFT,NHFT 937,15/10/2021,Local partnerships- MH,Adult mental health,5,What could we do better?,"My name is [Name redacted]. I am on Redwood 1 in Highbury Hospital. I have only just realized that when that under section 2 I am a voluntary patient. Now the application has been made for me to be on section 3, I am aware. When individuals in the ward 'dominate' each other in arguments it feels as if I am helpless to socialize and aid the situation; for myself. Staff do not care nor get involved, even when requested kindly. My knowledge of sections 2 and 3 is more importantly not very good, therefore should I wish to get leave to go home, or return home, it is rarely granted. I have left hospital grounds once before, yet even to get a breath of fresh air seems hard to come by. The staff and patients here are keeping me as if I am a caged animal. However just before the application has been made for section 3, I realise only then that I was on section 2, more specifically as a voluntary patient. During my stay here I did not realize I was a voluntary patient on section 2. Now the application has been made for me to be here under section 3 as a formal patient. I feel the actions of the patients and staff here are discussing and doing things that are beyond my comprehension. They have been doing this since I have entered the hospital, far too frequently for it to be considered a friendly or helpful response. I have been trapped here as a voluntary patient! It seems like when I play chess on my phone or the internet, there is little I can do, or by comparison when socializing or when I express myself. In conclusion, I was unable to leave the hospital under the Mental Health Act. The staff could manage the patients better. Individuals such as '[Nickname redacted]' seem to be dominating other males on the ward, asking them many questions about religion, politics and this is not appropriate. His actions are not being appropriately managed, and I feel and realize he is one of the many individuals stopping me from socializing with other human beings. This lack of human contact is not being managed properly. The nurse ""[Name redacted]"" seems to accompany me to every important appointment I have. She is elderly and African, and looks related to the man [Name redacted]! This is a silly comparison of course. The staff here when requested are not showing me there last names on their lanyards, when I want to make a formal or informal complaint, verbally, it goes unheard. They are professionals here. Individuals are taking videos on social media, and they aren't handling this correctly either. I have had visitors whilst I am here, yet it seems many patients here are coming and going as they please. I rarely get to leave here under section 2. I have trusted them with a lot of sensitive information which I think is quite important to consider in the way I am being 'handled' here. Expressing myself verbally seems extraordinarily difficult, as what I say, in comparison to what I type and write, can be easily misinterpreted. I would like to return home to my immediate family, and those I love and value. They have cared for me, yet I feel that my past life is not a fair representation, consciously, of the fact I took my medication improperly, or the way I am now. I am requesting a second chance to go home, be with family under the appropriate care - supervised community treatment. This voice went unheard until now, I feel the consideration for my argument was not there. My track record clearly demonstrates I have obliged the correct treatment in the past is not a valid comparison as to my actions in the present. I pray this information will be discarded, and my second chance flourish. I would like for people to hear my voice as my true self, instead of misrepresented information. I accept the treatment given, and the consequence of others' actions I am powerless over. I feel like a caged animal. This, in truth, is incorrect, yet whenever the opportunity arises for me to become break free, I am distracted or unable.",,5,,,,,,1,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,

So when I ring up and ask for a call from duty, there is nothing worse than sitting waiting for a call that never comes. So now I don't bother contacting them however bad or distressed I feel. I also was led to believe they would liaise with GP about my meds, but this never happened. So I spoke to my GP myself and sorted it with him myself. I am now on a waiting list but it took me lots of calls to find out what I'm waiting for, and now I find it could take a year to materialise. The admin people in the team are the kindest and most helpful in the team, and they say I can call duty in the meantime, but if I do then I either get no call back (which just increases my distress) or the duty person says to ring the Samaritans or my GP. I don't think I will get any help from this team, so I am finding other ways to get help or help myself. I had such high hopes when I was referred. I liked the idea of everything I heard - it just never came to anything.

I felt like I was treated like a criminal instead of a patient. I understand that A&E isn't full of mental health professionals, but if mental health helplines are sending people to A&E departments when in crisis, those people at A&E should be able to deal with it appropriately.
