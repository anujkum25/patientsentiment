sp,Staff,Professionalism/Competence Of Staff,"A lot. Our baby girl was born 6 weeks premature, mid 2019. She had a 8 - 12 month assessment form filled by myself. In [Redacted for data protection], it was given to the home visitor on [Redacted for data protection]. Due to my girl not having stood up supported by that time, and also COVID preventing the home visitor doing a height measurement and head measurement, they told us that they would return in [Redacted for data protection] to check on the gross motor skills and to do a full height measurement etc.  We then had a second visit week commencing [Redacted for data protection], my baby girl was standing up at the sofa on her own and was weighed and measured.  The same home visitor as before then asked if I had filled in the assessment form and I told her we had given it to her on her last visit.  The very next thing she said was the form we were given was incorrect it was for a full term baby and we should have been given a premature baby assessment form, therefore, my baby was on target for her adjusted age and doing fine in all areas and so this second meeting was not required.  How can someone question whether we had filled in a form and then say in the next breath, the form filled in was for full term babies? My assumption here is the form has gone missing!!  I then asked whether there would be any further assessments and she told me no not until the baby is 2 years old.  Fast forward to [Redacted for data protection] - now had another letter requesting a growth review!!! The NHS website states that these weight checks etc should be carried out NO MORE than every 3 months and that once the 1 year assessment is complete the next one is at 2 years old.  We have had 3 in 3 months!!  I point blank refuse to go to this one and will not be going to anymore until my baby is 2 years old, it is taking time out of mine or my husbands work for each one of these assessments, we have now been lied to, more than once. If my baby girl is not on track for her growth why are we not being told at the assessment?  According to her red book, all her measurements are fine or are we being lied to again? If a further assessment is required I want a full reason as to why, I want an explanation on why we haven't been told at past assessments. I also want compensation for loss of earnings for every future assessment before 2 years old, we have to attend whilst in working hours! Get it sorted!",-4,Trust A,Trust A - Q1,30

He was told he had to do a fasting blood test, then the following morning nurses escorted him down to breakfast, although my husband told the nurse that he couldn’t, the nurse still made him go down for it. After breakfast they came to do his fasting blood test but could not do it due to eating. My husband is petrified of needles so worried all night for nothing, he has now got to wait until after the weekend for this to be done again so more stress and worry for him. Took his laundry to be washed but machine broke down with his laundry in it!!. This has been in the machine for days now so he has no clean clothes and walking around with no socks on.

cc,Care received,Care received,"All my contact with the Hope Centre has left me feeling desperate and frustrated. I was referred 18 months ago and, apart from my initial assessment, have yet to have any treatment. Communication is often contradictory, phone calls are not returned, staff do not introduce themselves and I am made to feel like a problem, when I try to clarify what is happening. Promises of treatment are made regularly but never fulfilled. During this telephone call I was told that the doctor was going to chase up my treatment, but that she thought it best to discharge me 'in the hope' that the Stabilisation clinic would pick me up. She warned me that I may get lost in the system though. As my symptoms and mental health has worsened in the last three months to the point where I was considering self harm I asked if I should increase my medication (Fluoxetine) but the doctor suggested this was only a 'last resort' and that I should use Diazepam instead. She said if I couldn't get enough from my GP I could come to the Hope Centre for more. The phone call ended with the doctor assuring me that I wouldn't need to do anything, she would put into action the points raised. However, when I received the follow up letter a few days later it says that I am to call the Hope Centre in one month if I haven't had any further contact. Not only is that contradictory, but it puts pressure on me - the one suffering with PTSD, issues with trust, disorientation and disassociation - to make sure I don't fall out of the system.",-4,Trust A,Trust A - Q1,225

You could make you web portals and links much better. I was sign posted to you by my GP during a telephone consultation, due to the GP not being able to provide links, I had to seek further information directly, using the internet.  At first, web results took me to the Leicestershire pages, which simply told me 'I could self refer'. There were no hyper links, or at least no working ones.  The web page was very simplistic, and didn't seem to offer direct links to any useful material without me referring. This may not be the case, but that is my point, links should be very clear and concise. Advice leaflet links would be useful on the opening page. They could be all as user needs, and prevent them wasting time in the referral process. In a crisis situation, many people will struggle to process information, so it is highly important you present any you have openly and clearly. It also appears this services is predominately aimed at Nottingham resident, that is the impression I received after eventually finding the link to self referral.  Again even if that is not the case it is not helpful, when I feeling desperate enough to finally seek help.

dp,Dignity,Involvement: Of Service Users/Patients,"So let down. I understand the pandemic has disrupted services but this shouldn't alter the amount of group therapy given. Using the pandemic as an excuse to cut out months at the end of my group therapy because you thought I needed support then rather than later, is unacceptable. I wasn't given the option to make the decision for myself in my care. I had no choice I had to take the phone calls. If I had the choice I would've waited for group therapy to start rather than having to take one to one phone calls, as part of my group therapy time scale. If I was told that those phone calls would be taken off the end of my group therapy, and if I was given the choice I would've waited for group to start. Those phone calls really should've been classed as support calls rather than group MBT. I have waited years for this personalised therapy, I only get one chance in my lifetime to access it. Yet you have cut my time short by months. I now have to sit in group therapy listening to my therapist say to the new starters that they will have a ""full year of group therapy to explore their difficulties."" Hearing those words was like a dagger to my heart. You chose to end my therapy on fri 13th, the most unlucky day of the year. Also 3 days before my birthday. I also found out that I'm the first person to leave the group even though we all started together. Do you know how that all feels? Obviously no, thought has gone in to thinking about the individual, me. How all this would make me feel. I was also told I was going to get an Autism assessment. I've not heard anything so I guess this is no longer going ahead. I was told this assessment would help see if I have Autism or other mental health disorders, as it is looking like I have more than BPD. Now I feel all this research has stopped because of how soon you are making me leave, as there is not enough time now. I had high hopes for getting the treatment time needed but you didn't give it me. You can't alter treatment because of a pandemic especially when this treatment is a one off access. I understand that the pandemic put a hold on things that's fine, but to take away group therapy time is unacceptable.",-4,Trust A,Trust A - Q1,745

On other occasions we would have a call scheduled in and I would be waiting but the call would never come. I would then hear nothing until the following week when our next appointment was due and he would behave as if nothing had happened. During the sessions the therapist often talked over me, he would ask me a question and then go off on a tangent and not allow me to get a word in. One of the main issues I had was that he didn't take my opinions into account, particularly concerning my ongoing treatment. I felt I was not ready to be discharged from the service but there was a continual pressure for me to do so. The therapist kept bringing this up in our sessions and eventually texted me to tell me that I was being discharged from the service despite my wishes. In the message he explained the reason for this being that he was under pressure from management due to an extensive waiting list, I feel this is an unacceptable reason to discharge someone still in need of support. Over all I feel the lack of care and poor communication has really affected my experience and that the delivery of this type of service should be monitored more closely. I still feel that I am struggling with issues I really need support with.

sa,Staff,Attitude Of Staff,"Employ a doctor who, unlike Sharmar, listens & treats us as patients/human beings not sub-human prisoners.  This attitude of no empathy runs through 90% of the department. Every interaction is treated primarily with suspicion & doubt by healthcare.  Yes, we are prisoners, but we should be treated as patients, but the staff have treated us as prisoner & this goes against the founding principles of the NHS.  If this was a GP practice in the public most of us would seek an alternative, but we don’t have that choice.  Every interaction I have with healthcare leaves in fear & dread. 
I have witnessed other not getting their medications, these are not things that they can do without. Last week I had to speak to the good nurse on someone else’s behalf, because for 6 DAYS he hadn’t had his heart medication. This left him very unstable on his feet, he could barely make it twice a day to get his meal!
I also had to inform her that a man with cancer had run out of his daily meds (given weekly in a blister pack). They, healthcare, incorrectly accused him of “double dosing”.  I know this was not the case as I look after him, & ensured he took his medication. This I believe was a way to defer the blame instead of accepting responsibility. 
Every month I have various medications in possession and every month my anxiety levels go through the roof, because I fear what they will miss out.  This month it was lactulose & hay fever tablets, last month it was paracetamol, which they make me take instead of the DHO I was on previously for 7 years due to a trapped nerve in my neck.  This despite the specialist stating I should remain on it, yet the doctor here took me off them and now I have to beg for paracetamol every month. 
I appreciate some people abuse their medications, but I’ve been in jail for 10 years & have never been involved with this type of behaviour, yet every interaction with healthcare we are treated like we are ALL junkies trying to get something from them.  It’s got so bad (healthcare’s treatment of us) that I am now looking to move jails. 
Dentistry & opticians are equally as bad. 2-3 years to get an appointment then they leave us midway through treatment(dentist). 
We can wait years just for a simple eye test. 
Then this was exacerbated with COVID, but don’t be fooled these issues pre-date COVID.

sp,Staff,Professionalism/Competence Of Staff,"I had been experiencing Tendonitis for six month following stepping off a ladder incorrectly. However following treatment by a Chiropractor as we entered lockdown their services were suspended. I decided to make a self referral to the Physiotherapy Department and within a couple of weeks I was contacted by Adrian via a telephone consultation. Adrian provided excellent advice following an in depth consultation to establish the problems I was experiencing with my tendon. Although I had been following a exercise regime from another NHS Trust found on line, several segments of the routines were unsuitable for my particularly condition. In consultation with Adrian I commenced a series of exercises to enable my injury to gain the strength and mobility to aid my movement mainly during walking the dog and other activities. Although the tendon became quite sore at times, when completing the exercises, I slowly began to appreciate the support from Adrian and the healing process was very evident. To provide the consultation from Adrian during a pandemic I would imagine without a hands on approach clearly was very problematic for a physiotherapist.

With really bad tummy pains only to be told by the consultant to go home and manage pain at home. Which if that was the case I could have gone after the first day. The consultant advised she did not want to operate as I have had previous surgery on the same side, she would find it difficult to do the surgery and did not want to. Which I feel very let down by the nhs I have a cyst on my ovaries which is 5cm, been in pain for the last 7days and the consultant advised to manage pain at home , I really don’t see the point in this. I have had a cyst before which raptured after 7 days. So with my past medical history and the nhs website advising cysts that are 5cm or bigger and causing problems should be removed. Why the consultant won’t, I don’t know And if she finds it personally hard then she should have got someone you could do the surgery.",-4,Trust C,Trust C - Q1,6783

I have regularly received this type of treatment off doctors, I know they are busy, and they are good at what they do but seems that some doctors forget who they are talking to most of the time, which is sick and confused people. They do not seem to like it when patients know a lot about their conditions or us patients who like a proper in-depth explanation on everything that’s happening. But by them taking the extra 5-10 minutes explaining properly, can solve a lot of issues and confusion and lower our anxiety levels.

No face mask, wasn’t enough space to move around safely and the room was dirty. Very disappointing when the wards have high risk patients.
